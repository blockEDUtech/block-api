# block-api

## Development

Pre-requisites:
- MongoDB
- npm
- gulp

## Getting Started

Clone the repo:
```sh
git clone git@github.com:blockEDUtech/block-api.git
cd block-api
```

Install yarn:
```js
npm install -g yarn
```

Install dependencies:
```sh
yarn
```

Set environment (vars):
```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Start server:
```sh
# Start server
yarn start

# Selectively set DEBUG env var to get logs
DEBUG=express-mongoose-es6-rest-api:* yarn start
```
Refer [debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) to know how to selectively turn on logs.


Tests:
```sh
# Run tests written in ES6
yarn test

# Run test along with code coverage
yarn test:coverage

# Run tests on file change
yarn test:watch

# Run tests enforcing code coverage (configured via .istanbul.yml)
yarn test:check-coverage
```

Lint:
```sh
# Lint code with ESLint
yarn lint

# Run lint on any file change
yarn lint:watch
```

Other gulp tasks:
```sh
# Wipe out dist and coverage directory
gulp clean

# Default task: Wipes out dist and coverage directory. Compiles using babel.
gulp
```

##### Deployment

```sh
# compile to ES5
1. yarn build

# upload dist/ to your server
2. scp -rp dist/ user@dest:/path

# install production dependencies only
3. yarn --production

# Use any process manager to start your services
4. pm2 start dist/index.js
```

In production you need to make sure your server is always up so you should ideally use any of the process manager recommended [here](http://expressjs.com/en/advanced/pm.html).
We recommend [pm2](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/) as it has several useful features like it can be configured to auto-start your services if system is rebooted.

## Logging

Universal logging library [winston](https://www.npmjs.com/package/winston) is used for logging. It has support for multiple transports.  A transport is essentially a storage device for your logs. Each instance of a winston logger can have multiple transports configured at different levels. For example, one may want error logs to be stored in a persistent remote location (like a database), but all logs output to the console or a local file. We just log to the console for simplicity, you can configure more transports as per your requirement.

#### API logging
Logs detailed info about each api request to console during development.

#### Error logging
Logs stacktrace of error to console along with other details. You should ideally store all error messages persistently.

## Code Coverage
Get code coverage summary on executing `yarn test`

`yarn test` also generates HTML code coverage report in `coverage/` directory. Open `lcov-report/index.html` to view it.

## Docker

```sh
# For Development
# service restarts on file change
1. bash bin/development.sh
```

## A Boilerplate-only Option

If you would prefer not to use any of our tooling, delete the following files from the project: `package.json`, `gulpfile.babel.js`, `.eslintrc` and `.travis.yml`. You can now safely use the boilerplate with an alternative build-system or no build-system at all if you choose.
